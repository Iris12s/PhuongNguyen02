- Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) procedures with input validation for data integrity, the Java-based HW2 Standalone Application controls questions and answers. Inspired by Ed Discussion, it offers collections to keep and organize individual questions and responses as well as courses for them. The project uses test-driven development (TDD) to guarantee thorough testing of both legitimate and illegal actions. It incorporates thorough documentation, UML Class and Sequence Diagrams, and a screencast showing capability. Stored on a GitHub repository for review is the complete projectâ€”source code, documentation, test cases, and a video. While developing a functional discussion management system, one wants to show Java programming competency, object-oriented design, and best practices in software development.
